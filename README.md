# Winning The Space Race
### Background
* SpaceX claims their Falcon 9 rocket launches cost $62 million, while other providersâ€™ rocket launches cost $165+ million
* SpaceX can reuse the first stage launch, reducing costs
* For our research, we used SpaceX launch data and past launch data on the Falcon 9 to determine if a new company, SpaceY, could bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. This could be determined based on if the first stage launch will land, therefore reducing costs.
### Questions
* Based on SpaceX rocket launch data, can we predict if a launch will be successful?
* Can we reuse the first stage launch?
* How much will the total cost of a rocket launch be?
* What determines whether a launch will be successful?
